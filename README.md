# GameList

## About
I developed a [website](https://fortytwo-gamelist.herokuapp.com) for Code Institute's Backend Development Milestone Project. The website's goal is to allow user to insert, edit and delete list of games.
The website is designed to be simple and easy to use on any platform or scale.

Pushing will send your work to the repository

#### Heroku Deployment

To deploy to heroku, take the following steps:


1. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
2. Create a `Procfile` with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.
3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.
3. Create a new app on the [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to Europe.
4. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.
5. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.
6. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
7. Set the following config vars:
| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
DEBUG | FALSE
IP | 0.0.0.0
MONGO_URI | `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>-qtxun.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
PORT | 5000
SECRET_KEY | `<your_secret_key>`
- To get you MONGO_URI read the MongoDB Atlas documentation [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/)

8. In the heroku dashboard, click "Deploy".
9. In the "Manual Deployment" section of this page, made sure the master branch is selected and then click "Deploy Branch".
10. The site is now successfully deployed.

#### Forking
By forking the GitHub Repository, you can make a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.  This means we can view or make changes without making the changes affecting the original.

* Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the Repository there is a "Fork" button about the "Settings" button on the menu.
* You should now have a new copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

### Cloning
* Log into your GitHub then find the gitpod repository
* Under the repository name there is a button that says "Clone or download". Click on this button.
* If cloning with HTTPS "Clone with HTTPS", copy this link.
* Open Gitbash
* Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

        $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
        Press - Enter- Your local clone will be created.
        $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
                > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
